<h1 id="l4-aws-elastic-load-balancer-elb"><strong>L4 AWS Elastic Load Balancer – ELB</strong></h1>
<h2 id="1aws-elastic-load-balancer-elb"><strong>1、AWS Elastic Load Balancer – ELB</strong></h2>
<p>Elastic Load Balancer allows the <strong>incoming traffic to be distributed automatically across multiple healthy EC2 instances</strong>.</p>
<p>ELB serves as a single point of contact to the client</p>
<p><strong>ELB helps to being transparent and increases the application availability by allowing the addition or removal of multiple EC2 instances across one or more AZs</strong>, without disrupting the overall flow of information.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-elb-benefits"><strong>1-1 ELB benefits</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>is a distributed system that is fault-tolerant and actively monitored</strong></li>
<li>abstracts out the complexity of managing, maintaining, and scaling load balancers</li>
<li>can also serve as the first line of defense against attacks on network\</li>
<li><strong>can offload the work of encryption and decryption (SSL termination)</strong> so that the EC2 instances can focus on their main work</li>
<li>offers integration with Auto Scaling, which ensures enough back-end capacity available to meet varying traffic levels</li>
<li>are engineered to not be a single point of failure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-2-load-balancers-only-work-across-azs-within-a-region"><strong>1-2 Load Balancers only work across AZs within a region</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/chap3_4_1.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<h2 id="2aws-elastic-load-balancer-types"><strong>2、AWS Elastic Load Balancer Types</strong></h2>
<p>Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application Load Balancer</li>
<li>Network Load Balancer</li>
<li>Elastic Load Balancer </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3elastic-load-balancer-features"><strong>3、Elastic Load Balancer Features</strong></h2>
<p>Following ELB key concepts apply to all the Elastic Load Balancer types</p>
<h3 id="3-1-scaling-elb"><strong>3-1 Scaling ELB</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each ELB is allocated and configured with a default capacity</li>
<li><strong>ELB Controller</strong> is the service that <em>stores all the configurations and also monitors the load balancer and manages the capacity that is used to handle the client requests</em></li>
<li>As the traffic profile changes, the controller service scales the load balancers to handle more requests, <strong>scaling equally in all AZs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong><mark>ELB increases its capacity by utilizing either larger resources (scale up – resources with higher performance characteristics) or more individual resources (scale-out)</mark></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>AWS itself handles the scaling of the ELB capacity and this scaling is different to scaling of the EC2 instances to which the ELB routes its request, which is handled by Auto Scaling</strong></li>
<li><em>Time required for Elastic Load Balancing to scale can range from 1 to 7 minutes, depending on the changes in the traffic profile</em></li>
<li>When an Availability Zone is enabled for the load balancer, <strong>Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the Availability Zone.</strong></li>
<li>By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its Availability Zone only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-2-pre-warming-elb"><strong>3-2 Pre-Warming ELB</strong></h3>
<p><strong>NOTE – AWS documentation does not include Pre-warming now</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><mark>ELB works best with a gradual increase in traffic</mark></strong></li>
<li>AWS is able to scale automatically and handle a vast majority of use cases</li>
<li>However, in certain scenarios, if there is a flash traffic spike expected or a load test cannot be configured to gradually increase traffic, <strong>recommended to contact AWS support to have the load balancer “pre-warmed”</strong></li>
<li>A<strong>WS will help Pre-warming the ELB, by configuring the load balancer to have the appropriate level of capacity based on the expected traffic</strong></li>
<li>AWS would need the information for the start, end dates, and the expected request rate per second with the total size of request/response.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-3-dns-resolution"><strong>3-3 DNS Resolution</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>ELB is scaled automatically depending on the traffic profile</li>
<li><strong><mark>When scaled, Elastic Load Balancing service will update the Domain Name System (DNS) record of the load balancer so that the new resources have their respective IP addresses registered in DNS</mark></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>DNS record created includes a Time-to-Live (TTL) setting of 60 seconds</strong></li>
<li>By default, ELB will return multiple IP addresses when clients perform a DNS resolution, with the records being randomly ordered on each DNS resolution request.</li>
<li>It is recommended that clients will re-lookup the DNS at least every 60 seconds to take advantage of the increased capacity</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4load-balancer-types"><strong>4、Load Balancer Types</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Internet Load Balancer</strong></p>
<p>An Internet-facing load balancer takes requests from clients over the Internet and distributes them across the EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer</p>
<p><strong>Internal Load Balancer –</strong> </p>
<p>Internal load balancer <strong>routes traffic to EC2 instances in private subnets</strong></p>
<h2 id="5availability-zonessubnets"><strong>5、Availability Zones/Subnets</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elastic Load Balancer should have at least one subnet attached</strong></li>
<li>Elastic Load Balancing allows subnets to be added and creates a load balancer node in each of the Availability Zone where the subnet resides.</li>
<li><strong>Only one subnet per AZ can be attached to the ELB.</strong> Attaching a subnet with an AZ already attached replaces the existing subnet</li>
<li>Each Subnet must have a CIDR block with at least a /27 bitmask and h<strong>as at least 8 free IP addresses</strong>, which ELB uses to establish connections with the back-end instances.</li>
<li>For High Availability, it is recommended to attach one subnet per AZ for at least two AZs, even if the instances are in a single subnet.</li>
<li><strong>Subnets can be attached or detached from the ELB and it would start or stop sending requests to the instances in the subnet accordingly</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6security-groups-nacl"><strong>6、Security Groups &amp; NACL</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Security groups &amp; NACLs should allow Inbound traffic, on the load balancer listener port, from the Client for an Internet ELB or VPC CIDR for an Internal ELB</li>
<li>Security groups &amp; NACLs should allow Outbound traffic to the back-end instances on both the instance listener port and the health check port</li>
<li>NACLs, in addition, should allow responses on the ephemeral ports</li>
<li><strong>All EC2 instances should allow incoming traffic from ELB</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7ssl-negotiation-configuration"><strong>7、SSL Negotiation Configuration</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>For HTTPS load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing uses a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) negotiation configuration, known as a security policy, <strong>to negotiate SSL connections between a client and the load balancer.</strong></li>
<li>
<p>A security policy is a combination of <strong>SSL protocols, SSL ciphers, and the Server Order Preference option</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Elastic Load Balancing supports the following versions of the SSL protocol TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1,  TLS 1.0, SSL 3.0</li>
<li><strong>SSL protocols use several SSL ciphers to encrypt data over the Internet</strong>.</li>
<li>Elastic Load Balancing supports the <strong>Server Order Preference</strong> option for negotiating connections between a client and a load balancer.</li>
<li>During the SSL connection negotiation process, this allows the load balancer to control and select the first cipher in its list that is in the client’s list of ciphers instead of the default behavior of checking matching first cipher in client’s list with server’s list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elastic Load Balancer allows using a <strong>Predefined Security Policies or creating a Custom Security Policy for specific needs</strong>. If none is specified, ELB selects the latest Predefined Security Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elastic Load Balancer support multiple certificates using Server Name Indication (SNI)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If the hostname provided by a client matches a single certificate in the certificate list, the load balancer selects this certificate</strong>.</li>
<li>If a hostname provided by a client matches multiple certificates in the certificate list, the load balancer selects the best certificate that the client can support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>Classic Load Balancer does not support multiple certificates</mark></strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>ALB and NLB support multiple certificates</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8health-checks"><strong>8、Health Checks</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Load balancer performs health checks on all registered instances, whether the instance is in a healthy state or an unhealthy state.</li>
<li>Load balancer performs health checks to discover the availability of the EC2 instances, the load balancer periodically sends pings, attempts connections, or sends request to health check the EC2 instances.</li>
<li><strong><mark>Health check is InService for status of healthy instances and OutOfService for unhealthy ones</mark></strong></li>
<li>Load balancer sends a request to each registered instance at the *<em>Ping Protocol, Ping Port and Ping Path every HealthCheck Interval seconds</em>. <ul>
<li>It waits for the instance to respond within the Response Timeout period. <strong>If the health checks exceed the Unhealthy Threshold for consecutive failed responses, the load balancer takes the instance out of service</strong>. </li>
<li>When the health checks exceed the <strong>Healthy Threshold</strong> for consecutive successful responses, the load balancer puts the instance back in service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load balancer only sends requests to the healthy EC2 instances and stops routing requests to the unhealthy instances</li>
<li>All ELB types support health checks</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9listeners"><strong>9、Listeners</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Listeners is the process that checks for connection requests from client</li>
<li>Listeners are configured with a protocol and a port for front-end (client to load balancer) connections, and a protocol and a port for back-end (load balancer to back-end instance) connections.</li>
<li>Listeners support HTTP, HTTPS, SSL, TCP protocols</li>
<li><strong>An X.509 certificate is required for HTTPS or SSL connections and load balancer uses the certificate to terminate the connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the back-end instances.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you want to use SSL, but don’t want to terminate the connection on the load balancer, use TCP for connections from the client to the load balancer, use the SSL protocol for connections from the load balancer to the back-end application</strong>, and deploy certificates on the back-end instances handling requests.</li>
<li>If you use an HTTPS/SSL connection for your back end, you can enable authentication on the back-end instance. This authentication can be used to ensure that back-end instances accept only encrypted communication, and to ensure that the back-end instance has the correct certificates.</li>
<li><strong>ELB HTTPS listener does not support Client-Side SSL certificates</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="10idle-connection-timeout"><strong>10、Idle Connection Timeout</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>For each request that a client makes through a load balancer, it maintains two connections, for each client request, one connection is with the client, and the other connection is to the back-end instance.</li>
<li>For each connection, <strong><mark>the load balancer manages an idle timeout that is triggered when no data is sent over the connection for a specified time period</mark></strong>. If no data has been sent or received, it closes the connection after the idle timeout period (defaults to 60 seconds) has elapsed</li>
<li>For lengthy operations, such as file uploads, the idle timeout setting for the connections should be adjusted to ensure that lengthy operations have time to complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="11x-forwarded-headers-proxy-protocol-support"><strong>11、X-Forwarded Headers &amp; Proxy Protocol Support</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>As the Elastic Load Balancer intercepts the traffic between the client and the back-end servers, the back-end server does not know the IP address, Protocol, and the Port used between the Client and the Load balancer.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ELB provides X-Forwarded headers support to help back end servers track the same when using the HTTP protocol</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Forwarded-For request</strong> header to help back-end servers identify the IP address of a client when you use an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer.</li>
<li><strong>X-Forwarded-Proto request</strong> header to help back end servers identify the protocol (HTTP/S) that a client used to connect to the server</li>
<li><strong>X-Forwarded-Port request</strong> header to help back-end servers identify the port that an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer uses to connect to the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ELB provides <strong>Proxy Protocol</strong> support to help back-end servers track the same when using non-HTTP protocol or when using HTTPS and not terminating the SSL connection on the load balancer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proxy Protocol is an Internet protocol used to carry connection information from the source requesting the connection to the destination for which the connection was requested.</li>
<li><strong>Elastic Load Balancing uses Proxy Protocol version 1, which uses a human-readable header format with connection information such as the source IP address, destination IP address, and port numbers</strong></li>
<li>If the ELB is already behind a Proxy with the Proxy protocol enabled, enabling the Proxy Protocol on ELB would add the header twice</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="12cross-zone"><strong>12、Cross-Zone</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>By default, the load balancer distributes incoming requests <strong>evenly across its enabled Availability Zones for e.g. If AZ-a has 5 instances and AZ-b has 2 instances, the load will still be distributed 50% across each of the AZs</strong></li>
<li>Enabling Cross-Zone load balancing allows the <strong>ELB to distribute incoming requests evenly across all the back-end instances</strong>, regardless of the AZ</li>
<li>Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the AZ. By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its AZ only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled AZs.</li>
<li>Cross-zone load balancer reduces the need to maintain equivalent numbers of back-end instances in each Availability Zone, and improves application’s ability to handle the loss of one or more back-end instances.</li>
<li>It is still recommended to maintain approximately equivalent numbers of instances in each Availability Zone for higher fault tolerance.</li>
<li>With cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>ALB -&gt; Cross Zone load balancing is enabled by default and free</li>
<li>CLB -&gt; <strong>Cross Zone load balancing is disabled, by default, and can be enabled and free</strong></li>
<li>NLB -&gt; Cross Zone load balancing is disabled, by default, and can be enabled and but charged for inter-az data transfer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="13connection-draining-deregistration-delay"><strong>13、Connection Draining (Deregistration Delay)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>By default, if a registered EC2 instance with the ELB is deregistered or becomes unhealthy, the load balancer immediately closes the connection</li>
<li><strong>Connection draining can help the load balancer to complete the in-flight requests made while keeping the existing connections open, and preventing any new requests from being sent to the instances that are de-registering or unhealthy</strong>.</li>
<li>Connection draining helps perform maintenance such as <strong>deploying software upgrades or replacing back-end instances without affecting customers’ experience</strong></li>
<li>Connection draining allows you to specify a maximum time (between 1 and 3,600 seconds and default 300 seconds) to keep the connections alive before reporting the instance as de-registered. The maximum timeout limit does not apply to connections to unhealthy instances.</li>
<li>If the instances are part of an Auto Scaling group and connection draining is enabled for your load balancer, <strong>Auto Scaling waits for the in-flight requests to complete, or for the maximum timeout to expire, before terminating instances due to a scaling event or health check replacement.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="14sticky-sessions-session-affinity"><strong>14、sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>ELB can be configured to use <strong>Sticky Session feature (also called session affinity) which enables it to bind a user’s session to an instance and ensures all requests are sent to the same instance.</strong></li>
<li>Stickiness remains for a period of time which can be controlled by the application’s session cookie if one exists, or through a cookie, <strong>named AWSELB , created through Elastic Load balancer</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Sticky sessions for CLB and ALB are disabled, by default</strong>.</li>
<li>NLB does not support sticky sessions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-1-requirements"><strong>14-1 Requirements</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>An HTTP/HTTPS load balancer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>SSL traffic should be terminated on the ELB.</strong></li>
<li>ELB does session stickiness on an HTTP/HTTPS listener by utilizing an HTTP cookie. ELB has no visibility into the HTTP headers if the SSL traffic is not terminated on the ELB and is terminated on the back-end instance.“</li>
<li>At least one healthy instance in each Availability Zone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-2-duration-based-session-stickiness"><strong>14-2 Duration-Based Session Stickiness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration-Based Session Stickiness is maintained by ELB using a special cookie created to track the instance for each request to each listener.</li>
<li>When the load balancer receives a request,<ul>
<li><strong>it first checks to see if this cookie is present in the request. If so, the request is sent to the instance specified in the cookie.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If there is no cookie, the ELB chooses an instance based on the existing load balancing algorithm and a cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent requests from the same user to that instance.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stickiness policy configuration defines a cookie expiration, which establishes the duration of validity for each cookie.</li>
<li>Cookie is automatically updated after its duration expires.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="14-3-application-controlled-session-stickiness"><strong>14-3 Application-Controlled Session Stickiness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Load balancer uses a special cookie only to associate the session with the instance that handled the initial request, but follows the lifetime of the application cookie specified in the policy configuration.</li>
<li>Load balancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie if the application response includes a new application cookie. The load balancer stickiness cookie does not update with each request.</li>

<li>A customer has a web application that uses cookie Based sessions to track logged in users. It is deployed on AWS using ELB and Auto Scaling. The customer observes that when load increases Auto Scaling launches new Instances but the load on the existing Instances does not decrease, causing all existing users to have a sluggish experience. Which two answer choices independently describe a behavior that could be the cause of the sluggish user experience?<ul>
<li>ELB’s normal behavior sends requests from the same user to the same backend instance (its not by default)</li>
<li><strong>ELB’s behavior when sticky sessions are enabled causes ELB to send requests in the same session to the same backend</strong></li>
<li>A faulty browser is not honoring the TTL of the ELB DNS name (DNS TTL would only impact the ELB instances if scaled and not the EC2 instances to which the traffic is routed)</li>
<li><strong>The web application uses long polling such as comet or websockets. Thereby keeping a connection open to a web server tor a long time</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A customer has an online store that uses the cookie-based sessions to track logged-in customers. It is deployed on AWS using ELB and autoscaling. When the load increases, Auto scaling automatically launches new web servers, but the load on the web servers do not decrease. This causes the customers a poor experience. What could be causing the issue ?<ul>
<li>ELB DNS records Time to Live is set too high (DNS TTL would only impact the ELB instances if scaled and not the EC2 instances to which the traffic is routed)</li>

<li>You are designing a multi-platform web application for AWS. The application will run on EC2 instances and will be accessed from PCs, tablets and smart phones. Supported accessing platforms are Windows, MACOS, IOS and Android. Separate sticky session and SSL certificate setups are required for different platform types. Which of the following describes the most cost effective and performance efficient architecture setup?<ul>
<li>Setup a hybrid architecture to handle session state and SSL certificates on-prem and separate EC2 Instance groups running web applications for different platform types running in a VPC.</li>

<li>Set up two ELBs. The first ELB handles SSL certificates for all platforms and the second ELB handles session stickiness for all platforms for each ELB run separate EC2 instance groups to handle the web application for each platform.</li>
<li><strong>Assign multiple ELBs to an EC2 instance or group of EC2 instances running the common components of the web application, one ELB for each platform type. Session stickiness and SSL termination are done at the ELBs.

<li>You are migrating a legacy client-server application to AWS. The application responds to a specific DNS domain (e.g. www.example.com) and has a 2-tier architecture, with multiple application servers and a database server. Remote clients use TCP to connect to the application servers. The application servers need to know the IP address of the clients in order to function properly and are currently taking that information from the TCP socket. A Multi-AZ RDS MySQL instance will be used for the database. During the migration you can change the application code but you have to file a change request. How would you implement the architecture on AWS in order to maximize scalability and high availability?<ul>
<li><strong>File a change request to implement Proxy Protocol support In the application. Use an ELB with a TCP Listener and Proxy Protocol enabled to distribute load on two application servers in different AZs. (ELB with TCP listener and proxy protocol will allow IP to be passed )</strong></li>
<li>File a change request to Implement Cross-Zone support in the application. Use an ELB with a TCP Listener and Cross-Zone Load Balancing enabled, two application servers in different AZs.</li>
<li>File a change request to implement Latency Based Routing support in the application. Use Route 53 with Latency Based Routing enabled to distribute load on two application servers in different AZs.</li>

How can you best resolve the issue of the application responses not meeting your SLA?<ul>
<li><strong>Add another cc2 8xlarge application instance, and put both behind an Elastic Load Balancer</strong></li>
<li>Move the cc2 8xlarge to the same Availability Zone as the DynamoDB table (Does not improve the response time and performance)</li>
<li>Cache the database responses in ElastiCache for more rapid access (Data tier is responding fast)</li>

What step should you take to achieve this organization’s objective?<ul>
<li><strong>Nothing, there are no single points of failure in this architecture</strong>.</li>
<li>Create and attach a second IGW to provide redundant internet connectivity. (VPC can be attached only 1 IGW)</li>
<li>Create and configure a second Elastic Load Balancer to provide a redundant load balancer. (ELB scales by itself with multiple availability zones configured with it)</li>

<li>Your application currently leverages AWS Auto Scaling to grow and shrink as load Increases/ decreases and has been performing well. Your marketing team expects a steady ramp up in traffic to follow an upcoming campaign that will result in a 20x growth in traffic over 4 weeks. Your forecast for the approximate number of Amazon EC2 instances necessary to meet the peak demand is 175. What should you do to avoid potential service disruptions during the ramp up in traffic?<ul>

<li>To serve Web traffic for a popular product your chief financial officer and IT director have purchased 10 m1.large heavy utilization Reserved Instances (RIs) evenly spread across two availability zones: Route 53 is used to deliver the traffic to an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). After several months, the product grows even more popular and you need additional capacity As a result, your company purchases two c3.2xlarge medium utilization RIs You register the two c3.2xlarge instances with your ELB and quickly find that the ml large instances are at 100% of capacity and the c3.2xlarge instances have significant capacity that’s unused Which option is the most cost effective and uses EC2 capacity most effectively?<ul>
<li><strong>Use a separate ELB for each instance type and distribute load to ELBs with Route 53 weighted round robin</strong></li>
<li>Configure Autoscaling group and Launch Configuration with ELB to add up to 10 more on-demand mi large instances when triggered by CloudWatch shut off c3.2xlarge instances (increase cost as you still pay for the RI)</li>
<li>Route traffic to EC2 m1.large and c3.2xlarge instances directly using Route 53 latency based routing and health checks shut off ELB (will not still use the capacity effectively)</li>
<li>Configure ELB with two c3.2xlarge Instances and use on-demand Autoscailng group for up to two additional c3.2xlarge instances Shut on m1.large instances(Increases cost, as you still pay for the 10 m1.large RI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which header received at the EC2 instance identifies the port used by the client while requesting ELB?<ul>
<li>X-Forwarded-Proto</li>
<li>X-Requested-Proto</li>
<li><strong>X-Forwarded-Port</strong></li>
<li>X-Requested-Port</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A user has configured ELB with two instances running in separate AZs of the same region? Which of the below mentioned statements is true?<ul>
<li><strong>Multi AZ instances will provide HA with ELB (ELB provides HA to route traffic to healthy instances only it does not provide scalability)</strong></li>
<li>Multi AZ instances are not possible with a single ELB</li>
<li>Multi AZ instances will provide scalability with ELB</li>
<li>The user can achieve both HA and scalability with ELB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A user is configuring the HTTPS protocol on a front end ELB and the SSL protocol for the back-end listener in ELB. What will ELB do?<ul>
<li>It will allow you to create the configuration, but the instance will not pass the health check</li>
<li>Receives requests on HTTPS and sends it to the back end instance on SSL</li>
<li><strong>It will not allow you to create this configuration (Will give error “Load Balancer protocol is an application layer protocol, but instance protocol is not. Both the Load Balancer protocol and the instance protocol should be at the same layer. Please fix.”)</strong></li>
<li>It will allow you to create the configuration, but ELB will not work as expected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An ELB is diverting traffic across 5 instances. One of the instances was unhealthy only for 20 minutes. What will happen after 20 minutes when the instance becomes healthy?<ul>
<li>ELB will never divert traffic back to the same instance</li>
<li>ELB will not automatically send traffic to the same instance. However, the user can configure to start sending traffic to the same instance</li>
<li><strong>ELB starts sending traffic to the instance once it is healthy</strong></li>
<li>ELB terminates the instance once it is unhealthy. Thus, the instance cannot be healthy after 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A user has hosted a website on AWS and uses ELB to load balance the multiple instances. The user application does not have any cookie management. How can the user bind the session of the requestor with a particular instance?<ul>
<li>Bind the IP address with a sticky cookie</li>
<li>Create a cookie at the application level to set at ELB</li>
<li>Use session synchronization with ELB</li>
<li><strong>Let ELB generate a cookie for a specified duration</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A user has configured a website and launched it using the Apache web server on port 80. The user is using ELB with the EC2 instances for Load Balancing. What should the user do to ensure that the EC2 instances accept requests only from ELB?<ul>
<li>Open the port for an ELB static IP in the EC2 security group</li>
<li><strong>Configure the security group of EC2, which allows access to the ELB source security group</strong></li>
<li>Configure the EC2 instance so that it only listens on the ELB port</li>
<li>Configure the security group of EC2, which allows access only to the ELB listener</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AWS Elastic Load Balancer supports SSL termination.<ul>
<li>For specific availability zones only</li>
<li>False</li>
<li>For specific regions only</li>
<li><strong>For all regions</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User has launched five instances with ELB. How can the user add the sixth EC2 instance to ELB?<ul>
<li><strong>The user can add the sixth instance on the fly.</strong></li>
<li>The user must stop the ELB and add the sixth instance.</li>
<li>The user can add the instance and change the ELB config file.</li>
<li>The ELB can only have a maximum of five instances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
