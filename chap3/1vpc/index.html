<h1 id="l1-aws-virtual-private-cloud-vpc"><strong>L1 AWS Virtual Private Cloud – VPC</strong></h1>
<h2 id="1-vpc-overview-components"><strong>1 VPC Overview &amp; Components</strong></h2>
<p>A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to the AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud.</p>
<p>VPC allows the user to select IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, network gateways, and security settings.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-vpc-sizing"><strong>1-1 VPC Sizing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>VPC needs a set of IP addresses in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block for e.g, <code>10.0.0.0/16</code>, which allows <code>2^16 (65536)</code> IP address to be available </li>
<li>
<p>Allowed CIDR block size is between</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/28</code> netmask (minimum with <code>2^4</code>– 16 available IP address) and</li>
<li><code>/16</code> netmask (maximum with <code>2^16</code> – 65536 IP address)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CIDR block from private (non-publicly routable) IP address can be assigned</p>
<ul>
<li><code>10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255</code> (10/8 prefix)</li>
<li><code>172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255</code> (172.16/12 prefix)</li>
<li><code>192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255</code> (192.168/16 prefix)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s possible to specify a range of publicly routable IP addresses; however, direct access to the Internet is not currently supported from publicly routable CIDR blocks in a VPC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><mark>NOTE – You can now resize VPC</mark></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each VPC is separate from any other VPC created with the same CIDR block even if it resides within the same AWS account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VPC allows <strong>VPC Peering</strong> connections with other VPC within the same or different AWS accounts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection between your VPC and corporate or home network can be established</strong>, <strong>however the CIDR blocks should be not be overlapping</strong> for e.g. <strong><mark>VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 can communicate with 10.1.0.0/16 corporate network but the connections would be dropped if it tries to connect to 10.0.37.0/16 corporate network cause of overlapping ip addresses.</mark></strong></p>

<h3 id="1-2-vpc-peering"><strong>1-2 VPC Peering</strong></h3>
<p>VPC allows VPC Peering connections with other VPC within the same or different AWS accounts</p>
<p><strong>VPC Peering Overview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables routing of traffic between them using private IP addresses.</li>
<li>Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network</li>
<li>VPC peering connection can be established between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account in a single different region.</li>
<li>AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a VPC peering connection; it is neither a gateway nor a VPN connection, and does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware.</li>
<li><strong>There is no single point of failure for communication or a bandwidth bottleneck</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VPC Peering Rules &amp; Limitations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VPC peering connection cannot be created between VPCs that have matching or overlapping CIDR blocks.</li>
<li><strong>VPC Peering is now supported inter-region</strong></li>
<li>VPC peering connection are limited on the number active and pending VPC peering connections that you can have per VPC.</li>
<li><strong><mark>VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships</mark></strong>. <ul>
<li>In a VPC peering connection, the VPC does not have access to any other VPCs that the peer VPC may be peered with even if established entirely within your own AWS account</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>VPC peering does not support Edge to Edge Routing Through a Gateway or Private Connection</strong></li>
<li>In a VPC peering connection, the VPC <strong>does not have access</strong> to any other connection that the peer VPC may have and vice versa. Connections that the peer VPC can include</li>
<li><strong>A VPN connection or an AWS Direct Connect connection to a corporate network</strong><ul>
<li><strong>An Internet connection through an Internet gateway</strong></li>
<li><strong>An Internet connection in a private subnet through a NAT device</strong></li>
<li><strong>A ClassicLink connection to an EC2-Classic instance</strong></li>
<li><strong>A VPC endpoint to an AWS service; for example, an endpoint to S3</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only one VPC peering connection can be established between the same two VPCs at the same time</li>
<li>Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) across a VPC peering connection is 1500 bytes.</li>
<li>A placement group can span peered VPCs that are <strong><mark>in the same region</mark>;</strong> however, you do not get full-bisection bandwidth between instances in peered VPCs</li>
<li>Any tags created for the VPC peering connection are only applied in the account or region in which they were created</li>
<li><strong>Unicast reverse path forwarding in VPC peering connections is not supported</strong></li>
<li><strong>Instance’s Public DNS can now be resolved to its private IP address across peered VPCs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VPC Peering Architecture</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/chap3_1_1.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>VPC Peering can be applied to create shared services or perform authentication with an on-premises instance</li>
<li>This would help creating a single point of contact, as well limiting the VPN connections to a single account or VPC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>A company has an AWS account that contains <strong>three VPCs (Dev, Test, and Prod) in the same region.</strong> Test is peered to both Prod and Dev. All VPCs have non-overlapping CIDR blocks. The company wants to push minor code releases from Dev to Prod to speed up time to market. Which of the following options helps the company accomplish this?</p>

<li><strong>Create a new peering connection Between Prod and Dev along with appropriate routes.</strong></li>
<li>Create a new entry to Prod in the Dev route table using the peering connection as the target.</li>
<li>Attach a second gateway to Dev. Add a new entry in the Prod route table identifying the gateway as the target.</li>
<li>The VPCs have non-overlapping CIDR blocks in the same account. The route tables contain local routes for all VPCs.</li>
<li><strong>VPC allows you to set tenancy option for the Instances launched in it</strong>. By default, the tenancy option is shared. If dedicated option selected, all the instances within it are launched on a dedicated hardware overriding the individual instance tenancy setting</li>
<li>Deletion of the VPC is possible only after terminating all instances within the VPC, and <strong><em>deleting all the components with the VPC for e.g. subnets, security groups, network ACLs, route tables, Internet gateways, VPC peering connections, and DHCP options</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-ip-addresses"><strong>2 IP Addresses</strong></h2>
<p>Instances launched in the VPC can have Private, Public and Elastic IP address assigned to it and are properties of ENI (Network Interfaces)</p>
<p><strong>Private IP Addresses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Private IP addresses are not reachable over the Internet, and can be used for <strong>communication only between the instances within the VPC</strong></li>
<li><strong>All instances are assigned a private IP address</strong>, within the IP address range of the subnet, to the default network interface</li>
<li><strong>Primary IP</strong> address is associated with the network interface for its lifetime, even when the instance is stopped and restarted and <strong>is released only when the instance is terminated</strong></li>
<li>Additional Private IP addresses, known as secondary private IP address, can be assigned to the instances and these can be reassigned from one network interface to another</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public IP address</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public IP addresses are reachable over the Internet</strong>, and can be used for communication between instances and the Internet, or with other AWS services that have public endpoints</li>
<li>Public IP address assignment to the Instance <strong>depends if the Public IP Addressing is enabled for the Subnet</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Public IP address can also be assigned to the Instance by enabling the Public IP addressing during the creation of the instance</strong>, which overrides the subnet’s public IP addressing attribute</li>
<li>Public IP address is assigned from <strong>AWS pool of IP addresses and it is not associated with the AWS account</strong> and hence is released when the instance is stopped and restarted or terminated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elastic IP address</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><mark>Elastic IP addresses are static, persistent public IP addresses which can be associated and disassociated with the instance, as required</mark></strong></li>
<li><strong>Elastic IP address is allocated at an VPC and owned by the account unless released</strong></li>
<li><strong>A Network Interface can be assigned either a Public IP or an Elastic IP</strong>. If you assign an instance, already having an Public IP, an Elastic IP, the public IP is released</li>
<li><strong>Elastic IP addresses can be moved from one instance to another</strong>, which can be within the same or different VPC within the same account</li>
<li>Elastic IP are charged for non usage i.e. if it is not associated or associated with a stopped instance or an unattached Network Interface</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3elastic-network-interface-eni"><strong>3、Elastic Network Interface (ENI)</strong></h2>

<li><strong>Primary private IP address</strong></li>
<li><strong>One or more secondary private IP addresses</strong></li>
<li><strong>One Elastic IP address per private IP address</strong></li>
<li><strong>One public IP address, which can be auto-assigned to the network interface for eth0</strong> when you launch an instance, but only when you create a network interface for eth0 instead of using an existing ENI</li>
<li><strong>One or more security groups</strong></li>
<li>A MAC address</li>
<li>A source/destination check flag</li>
<li>A description</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ENI’s attributes</strong> follow the <em>ENI as it is attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance</em>. When an ENI is moved from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected to the new instance.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple ENIs can be attached to an instance</strong> and is useful for use cases:<ul>
<li>Create a management network.</li>
<li>Use network and security appliances in your VPC.</li>
<li>Create dual-homed instances with workloads/roles on distinct subnets.</li>

<li>Each VPC has a <strong>implicit router to route network traffic</strong></li>
<li>Each VPC has a <strong>Main Route table, and can have multiple custom route tables created</strong></li>
<li><strong>Each Subnet within a VPC must be associated with a single route table at a time,</strong> while a route table can have multiple subnets associated with it</li>
<li>Subnet, if not explicitly associated to a route table, is implicitly associated with the main route table</li>
<li><strong>Every route table contains a local route that enables communication within a VPC which cannot be modified or deleted</strong></li>
<li><strong>Route priority is decided by matching the most specific route in the route table that matches the traffic</strong></li>
<li><strong>Route tables needs to be updated to defined routes for Internet gateways</strong>, Virtual Private gateways, VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints, NAT Device etc.</li>

<h2 id="5-internet-gateways-igw"><strong>5 Internet Gateways – IGW</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>An Internet gateway is a <strong>horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in the VPC and the Internet</strong>.</li>
<li>IGW imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on the network traffic.</li>
<li>An Internet gateway serves two purposes:<ul>
<li><strong>To provide a target in the VPC route tables for Internet-routable traffic,</strong></li>
<li><strong>To perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been NOT been assigned public IP addresses</strong>.</li>

<p>NAT gateway is a AWS managed NAT service that provides better availability, higher bandwidth, and requires less administrative effort.</p>
<ul>
<li>A NAT gateway supports bursts of up to <strong>10 Gbps of bandwidth</strong>.</li>
<li>For over 10 Gbps bursts requirement, the workload can be distributed by splitting the resources into multiple subnets, <strong>and creating a NAT gateway in each subnet</strong></li>
<li><strong>NAT gateway is associated with One Elastic IP address which cannot be disassociated after it’s creation.</strong></li>
<li>Each NAT gateway is created in a <strong>specific Availability Zone and implemented with redundancy in that zone</strong>.</li>
<li>A NAT gateway supports the following protocols: <strong>TCP, UDP, and ICMP</strong>.</li>
<li>NAT gateway cannot be associated a security group. <strong>Security can be configured for the instances in the private subnets to control the traffic</strong></li>
<li><strong>Network ACL can be used to control the traffic to and from the subnet. NACL applies to the NAT gateway’s traffic, which uses ports 1024-65535</strong></li>
<li>NAT gateway when created receives an elastic network interface that’s automatically assigned a private IP address from the IP address range of the subnet. <strong>Attributes of this network interface cannot be modified</strong></li>
<li><strong>NAT gateway cannot send traffic over VPC endpoints, VPN connections, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering connections</strong>. Private subnet’s route table should be modified to route the traffic directly to these devices.</li>

<p>A web company is looking to implement an external payment service into their highly available application deployed in a VPC. Their application EC2 instances are behind a public facing ELB. Auto scaling is used to add additional instances as traffic increases. Under normal load the application runs 2 instances in the Auto Scaling group but at peak it can scale 3x in size. <strong>The application instances need to communicate with the payment service over the Internet, which requires whitelisting of all public IP addresses used to communicate with it</strong>. <strong>A maximum of 4 whitelisting IP addresses are allowed at a time and can be added through an API</strong>.

<li><strong>Connection Tracking</strong> is maintained only <strong>if there is no explicit Outbound rule for an Inbound request</strong> (and vice versa)</li>
<li>However, if there is an explicit Outbound rule for an Inbound request, <strong>the response traffic is allowed on the basis of the Outbound rule and not on the Tracking information</strong></li>
<li>Tracking flow e.g.<ul>
<li>If an instance (host A) initiates traffic to host B and uses a protocol other than TCP, UDP, or ICMP, the instance’s firewall only tracks the IP address &amp; protocol number for the purpose of allowing response traffic from host B.</li>
<li>If host B initiates traffic to the instance in a separate request within 600 seconds of the original request or response, the instance accepts it regardless of inbound security group rules, because it’s regarded as response traffic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This can be controlled by modifying the security group’s outbound rules to permit only certain types of outbound traffic. Alternatively, Network ACLs (NACLs) can be used for the subnet, network ACLs are stateless and therefore do not automatically allow response traffic.</li>

<li><strong>Using network ACLs, you can deny access from a specific IP range</strong></li>
<li><strong>Keep network ACL rules simple and use a security group to restrict application level access</strong></li>
<li>NACLs are associated with a single Availability Zone (<strong><mark>associated with Subnet</mark></strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are designing security inside your VPC. You are considering the options for establishing separate security zones and enforcing network traffic rules across different zone to limit Instances can communications.  How would you accomplish these requirements? Choose 2 answers<ul>
<li>Configure a security group for every zone. Configure a default allow all rule. Configure explicit deny rules for the zones that shouldn’t be able to communicate with one another (<strong>Security group does not allow deny rules</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Configure you instances to use pre-set IP addresses with an IP address range every security zone. Configure NACL to explicitly allow or deny communication between the different IP address ranges, as required for interzone communication</strong></li>
<li><strong>Configure a security group for every zone. Configure allow rules only between zone that need to be able to communicate with one another. Use implicit deny all rule to block any other traffic</strong></li>
<li>Configure multiple subnets in your VPC, one for each zone. Configure routing within your VPC in such a way that each subnet only has routes to other subnets with which it needs to communicate, and doesn’t have routes to subnets with which it shouldn’t be able to communicate. (<strong>default routes are unmodifiable</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<li>Your entire AWS infrastructure lives inside of one Amazon VPC. You have an Infrastructure monitoring application running on an Amazon instance in Availability Zone (AZ) A of the region, and another application instance running in AZ B. The monitoring application needs to make use of ICMP ping to confirm network reachability of the instance hosting the application. Can you configure the security groups for these instances to only allow the ICMP ping to pass from the monitoring instance to the application instance and nothing else” If so how?<ul>
<li>No Two instances in two different AZ’s can’t talk directly to each other via ICMP ping as that protocol is not allowed across subnet (i.e. broadcast) boundaries (<strong>Can communicate</strong>)</li>
<li>Yes Both the monitoring instance and the application instance have to be a part of the same security group, and that security group needs to allow inbound ICMP (<strong>Need not have to be part of same security group</strong>)</li>
<li><strong><mark>Yes, The security group for the monitoring instance needs to allow outbound ICMP and the application instance’s security group needs to allow Inbound ICMP (is stateful, so just allow outbound ICMP from monitoring and inbound ICMP on monitored instance)</mark></strong></li>
<li>Yes, Both the monitoring instance’s security group and the application instance’s security group need to allow both inbound and outbound ICMP ping packets since ICMP is not a connection-oriented protocol (Security groups are stateful)</li>
</ul>

<li>A user has configured a VPC with a new subnet. The user has created a security group. The user wants to configure that instances of the same subnet communicate with each other. How can the user configure this with the security group?<ul>
<li>There is no need for a security group modification as all the instances can communicate with each other inside the same subnet</li>
<li>Configure the subnet as the source in the security group and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports</li>
<li><strong>Configure the security group itself as the source and allow traffic on all the protocols and ports</strong></li>
<li>The user has to use VPC peering to configure this</li>

<li>You are designing a data leak prevention solution for your VPC environment. You want your VPC Instances to be able to access software depots and distributions on the Internet for product updates. The depots and distributions are accessible via third party CDNs by their URLs. You want to explicitly deny any other outbound connections from your VPC instances to hosts on the Internet. Which of the following options would you consider?<ul>
<li><strong>Configure a web proxy server in your VPC and enforce URL-based rules for outbound access Remove default routes. (Security group and NACL cannot have URLs in the rules nor does the route)</strong></li>
<li>Implement security groups and configure outbound rules to only permit traffic to software depots.</li>
<li>Move all your instances into private VPC subnets remove default routes from all routing tables and add specific routes to the software depots and distributions only.</li>
<li>Implement network access control lists to all specific destinations, with an Implicit deny as a rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have an EC2 Security Group with several running EC2 instances. You change the Security Group rules to allow inbound traffic on a new port and protocol, and launch several new instances in the same Security Group. The new rules apply:<ul>
<li><strong>Immediately to all instances in the security group</strong>.</li>
<li>Immediately to the new instances only.</li>
<li>Immediately to the new instances, but old instances must be stopped and restarted before the new rules apply.</li>
<li>To all instances, but it may take several minutes for old instances to see the changes.</li>

<ul>
<li>For a VPN connection, the route table for the subnets s<strong>hould be updated with the type of routing (static of dynamic) that you plan to use</strong>.</li>
<li>Route tables determine where network traffic is directed. Traffic destined for the VPN connections must be routed to the virtual private gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Type of routing can depend on the make and model of your VPN devices</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Static Routing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If your device does not support BGP, specify static routing</strong>.</li>
<li>Using static routing, the routes (IP prefixes) can be specified that should be communicated to the virtual private gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Devices that don’t support BGP may also perform health checks</strong> to assist failover to the second tunnel when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BGP dynamic routing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the VPN device supports <strong>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong>, specify dynamic routing with the VPN connection.</li>
<li>When using a BGP device, static routes need not be specified to the VPN connection because the device uses BGP for auto discovery and to advertise its routes to the virtual private gateway.</li>
<li>
<p>BGP-capable devices are recommended as the BGP protocol offers robust liveness detection checks that can assist failover to the second VPN tunnel if the first tunnel goes down.
Only IP prefixes known to the virtual private gateway, either through BGP advertisement or static route entry, can receive traffic from your VPC.
Virtual private gateway does not route any other traffic destined outside of the advertised BGP, static route entries, or its attached VPC CIDR.</p>

<ul>
<li>A VPN connection is used to connect the customer network to a VPC.</li>
<li><strong>Each VPN connection has two tunnels to help ensure connectivity in case one of the VPN connections becomes unavailable, with each tunnel using a unique virtual private gateway public IP address</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Both tunnels should be configured for redundancy</strong>.</li>
<li>When one tunnel becomes unavailable, for e.g. down for maintenance, network traffic is automatically routed to the available tunnel for that specific VPN connection.</li>
<li>To protect against a loss of connectivity in case the customer gateway becomes unavailable, a second VPN connection can be setup to the VPC and virtual private gateway by using a second customer gateway.</li>
<li><strong>Customer gateway IP address for the second VPN connection must be publicly accessibl</strong>e.</li>
<li>By using redundant VPN connections and CGWs, maintenance on one of the customer gateways can be performed while traffic continues to flow over the second customer gateway’s VPN connection.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically routed VPN connections using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) are recommended, if available, to exchange routing information between the customer gateways and the virtual private gateways</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Statically routed VPN connections require static routes for the network to be entered on the customer gateway side</strong>.</li>
<li>BGP-advertised and statically entered route information allow gateways on both sides to determine which tunnels are available and reroute traffic if a failure occurs.</li>

<li>One Public Subnet for ELB, two Private Subnets for the web-servers, and two private subnets for the RDS</li>
<li><strong>Two Public Subnets for ELB, two private Subnet for the web-servers, and two private subnet for the RDS</strong></li>
<li>Two Public Subnets for ELB, two Public Subnet for the web-servers, and two public subnets for the RDS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have an Amazon VPC with one private subnet and one public subnet with a Network Address Translator (NAT) server. You are creating a group of Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances that configure themselves at startup via downloading a bootstrapping script from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) that deploys an application via GIT. Which setup provides the highest level of security?<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon EC2 instances in private subnet, no EIPs, route outgoing traffic via the NAT</strong></li>
<li>Amazon EC2 instances in public subnet, no EIPs, route outgoing traffic via the Internet Gateway (IGW)</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 instances in private subnet, assign EIPs, route outgoing traffic via the Internet Gateway (IGW)</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 instances in public subnet, assign EIPs, route outgoing traffic via the NAT</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have launched an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance into a public subnet with a primary private IP address assigned, an internet gateway is attached to the VPC, and the public route table is configured to send all Internet-based traffic to the Internet gateway. The instance security group is set to allow all outbound traffic but cannot access the Internet. Why is the Internet unreachable from this instance?<ul>
<li><strong>The instance does not have a public IP address</strong></li>
<li>The Internet gateway security group must allow all outbound traffic.</li>
<li>The instance security group must allow all inbound traffic.</li>
<li>The instance “Source/Destination check” property must be enabled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have an environment that consists of a public subnet using Amazon VPC and 3 instances that are running in this subnet. These three instances can successfully communicate with other hosts on the Internet. You launch a fourth instance in the same subnet, using the same AMI and security group configuration you used for the others, but find that this instance cannot be accessed from the internet. What should you do to enable Internet access?<ul>
<li>Deploy a NAT instance into the public subnet.</li>
<li><strong>Assign an Elastic IP address to the fourth instance</strong></li>
<li>Configure a publically routable IP Address in the host OS of the fourth instance.</li>
<li>Modify the routing table for the public subnet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have a load balancer configured for VPC, and all back-end Amazon EC2 instances are in service. However, your web browser times out when connecting to the load balancer’s DNS name. Which options are probable causes of this behavior? Choose 2 answers<ul>
<li><strong>The load balancer was not configured to use a public subnet with an Internet gateway configured</strong></li>
<li>The Amazon EC2 instances do not have a dynamically allocated private IP address</li>
<li><strong>The security groups or network ACLs are not property configured for web traffic.</strong></li>
<li>The load balancer is not configured in a private subnet with a NAT instance.</li>
<li>The VPC does not have a VGW configured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When will you incur costs with an Elastic IP address (EIP)?<ul>
<li>When an EIP is allocated.</li>
<li>When it is allocated and associated with a running instance.</li>
<li><strong>When it is allocated and associated with a stopped instance.</strong></li>
<li>Costs are incurred regardless of whether the EIP is associated with a running instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A company currently has a VPC with EC2 Instances. A new instance being launched, which will host an application that works on IPv6. You need to ensure that this instance can initiate outgoing traffic to the Internet. At the same time, you need to ensure that no incoming connection can be initiated from the Internet on to the instance. Which of the following would you add to the VPC for this requirement?<ul>
<li>A NAT Instance</li>
<li>A NAT Gateway</li>
<li>An Internet Gateway</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</li>
