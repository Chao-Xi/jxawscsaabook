<h1 id="l1-aws-identity-access-management-iam"><strong>L1 AWS Identity Access Management – IAM</strong></h1>
<h2 id="1-aws-iam-overview"><strong>1 AWS IAM Overview</strong></h2>
<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users.</p>
<p><strong>IAM is used to control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity – who can use your AWS resources (authentication)</strong></li>
<li>Identity – who can use your AWS resources (authentication)</li>
</ul>
<p>IAM also enables access to resources across AWS accounts.</p>
<h2 id="2-iam-features"><strong>2 IAM Features</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared access to your AWS account</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Grant other people permission to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share your password or access key.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Granular permissions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each user can be granted with different set granular permissions as required to perform their job</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on EC2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>IAM can help provide applications running on EC2 instance temporary credentials that they need in order to access other AWS resources</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity federation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>IAM allows users to access AWS resources, without requiring the user to have accounts with AWS, by providing temporary credentials for e.g. through corporate network or Google or Amazon authentication </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity information for assurance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>CloudTrail can be used to receive log records that include information about those who made requests for resources in the account.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PCI DSS Compliance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>IAM supports the processing, storage, and transmission of credit card data by a merchant or service provider, and <strong>has been validated as being Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) complian</strong>t</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrated with many AWS services</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>IAM integrates with almost all the AWS services</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Eventually Consistent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IAM, like many other AWS services, is eventually consistent and achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within Amazon’s data centers around the world.</li>
<li>Changes made to IAM would be eventually consistent and hence would take some time to reflect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free to use</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IAM is offered at no additional charge and charges are applied only for use of other AWS products by your IAM users.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AWS Security Token Service</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IAM provide STS which is an included feature of the AWS account offered at no additional charge.</li>
<li>AWS charges only for the use of other AWS services accessed by the AWS STS temporary security credentials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-identities"><strong>3 Identities</strong></h2>
<p>IAM identities determine who can access and help to provide authentication for people and processes in your AWS account</p>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/chap4_1_1.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<h2 id="4-account-root-user"><strong>4 Account Root User</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Root Account Credentials are the email address and password with which you sign-in into the AWS account</li>
<li>Root Credentials has full unrestricted access to AWS account including the account security credentials which include sensitive information</li>
<li><strong><em>IAM Best Practice – Do not use or share the Root account once the AWS account is created, instead create a separate user with admin privilege</em></strong></li>
<li>An Administrator account can be created for all the activities which too has full access to the AWS account except the accounts security credentials, billing information and ability to change password</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-iam-users"><strong>5 IAM Users</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>IAM user represents the person or service who uses the access to interact with AWS.</li>
<li><strong><mark>IAM Best Practice – Create Individual Users</mark></strong></li>
<li>User credentials can consist of the following<ul>
<li><strong>Password to access AWS services through AWS Management Console</strong></li>
<li><strong>Access Key/Secret Access Key to access AWS services through API, CLI or SDK</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IAM user starts with no permissions and is not authorized to perform any AWS actions on any AWS resources and should be granted permissions as per the job function requirement</li>
<li><strong><mark>IAM Best Practice – Grant least Privilege</mark></strong></li>
<li>Each IAM user is associated with one and only one AWS account.</li>
<li>IAM User cannot be renamed from AWS management console and has to be done from CLI or SDK tools.</li>
<li>IAM handles the renaming of user w.r.t unique id, groups, policies where the user was mentioned as a principal. However, you need to handle the renaming in the policies where the user was mentioned as a resource</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/chap4_1_2.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<h2 id="6-iam-groups"><strong>6 IAM Groups</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>IAM group is a collection of IAM users</li>
<li>IAM groups can be used to specify permissions for a collection of users sharing the same job function making it easier to manage</li>
<li><strong><em>IAM Best Practice – Use groups to assign permissions to IAM Users</em></strong></li>
<li>A group is not truly an identity because it cannot be identified as a Principal in an access policy. It is only a way to attach policies to multiple users at one time</li>
<li>A group can have multiple users, while a user can belong to multiple groups (10 max)</li>
<li>Groups cannot be nested and can only have users within it</li>
<li>AWS does not provide any default group to hold all users in it and if one is required it should be created with all users assigned to it.</li>
<li>Renaming of a group name or path, IAM handles the renaming w.r.t to policies attached to the group, unique ids, users within the group. However, IAM does not update the policies where the group is mentioned as a resource and must be handled manually</li>
<li>Deletion of the groups requires you to detach users and managed policies and delete any inline policies before deleting the group. With AWS management console, the deletion and detachment is taken care of.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-iam-roles"><strong>7 IAM Roles</strong></h2>
<h3 id="7-1-aws-iam-role"><strong>7-1 AWS IAM Role</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>IAM role is very similar to a user, in that it is an identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.</li>
<li>IAM role is not intended to be uniquely associated with a particular user, group or service and is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.</li>
<li>Role does not have any credentials (password or access keys) associated with it and whoever assumes the role is provided with a dynamic temporary credentials</li>
<li>Role helps in access delegation to grant permissions to someone that allows access to resources that you control</li>
<li>Roles can help to prevent accidental access to or modification of sensitive resources</li>
<li>Modification of a Role can be done anytime and the changes are reflected across all the entities associated with the Role immediately<ul>
<li>IAM Role plays a very important role in the following scenarios</li>
<li>Services like EC2 instance running an application that needs to access other AWS services</li>
<li>Allowing users from different AWS accounts have access to AWS resources in different account, instead of having to create users</li>
<li>Company uses a Corporate Authentication mechanism and don’t want the User to authenticate twice or create duplicate users in AWS</li>
<li>Applications allowing login through <strong><em>external authentication mechanism e.g. Amazon, Facebook, Google etc</em></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Role can be assumed by<ul>
<li>IAM user within the same AWS account</li>
<li>IAM user from a different AWS account</li>
<li>AWS service such as EC2, EMR to interact with other services</li>
<li>An external user authenticated by an external identity provider (IdP) service that is compatible with SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC), or a custom-built identity broker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Role involves defining two policies<ul>
<li><strong>Trust policy</strong><ul>
<li>Trust policy defines – who can assume the role</li>
<li>Trust policy involves setting up a trust between the account that owns the resource (trusting account) and the account who owns the user that needs access to the resources (trusted account)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Permissions policy</strong><ul>
<li>Permissions policy defines – what they can access</li>
<li>Permissions policy determines authorization, which grants the user of the role with the needed permissions to carry out the desired tasks on the resource</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Federation</strong> is creating a trust relationship between an external Identity Provider (IdP) and AWS<ul>
<li>Users can also sign in to an enterprise identity system that is compatible with SAML</li>
<li>Users can sign in to a web identity provider, such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any IdP that is compatible with OpenID connect (OIDC).</li>
<li>When using OIDC and SAML 2.0 to configure a trust relationship between these external identity providers and AWS, the user is assigned to an IAM role and receives temporary credentials that enables the user to access AWS resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IAM Best Practice – Use roles for applications running on EC2 instances</strong></li>
<li><strong>IAM Best Practice – Delegate using roles instead of sharing credentials</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-2-role-types"><strong>7-2 Role types</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>AWS Security Token Service (STS) helps create and provide trusted users with temporary security credentials that control access to AWS resources</li>
<li>STS is a global service with a single endpoint <code>https://sts.amazonaws.com</code></li>
<li>AWS STS API calls can be made either to a global endpoint or to one of the regional endpoints. Regional endpoint can help reduce latency and improve the performance of the API calls</li>
<li><strong>Temporary Credentials are similar to Long Term Credentials except for</strong><ul>
<li>are short term and are regularly rotated</li>
<li>can be configured to last from few minutes to several hours</li>
<li>do not have to be embedded or distributed</li>
<li>are not stored or attached with the User, but are generated dynamically and provided to the user as and when requested</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-3-role-types"><strong>7-3 Role types</strong></h3>
<h4 id="aws-service-roles"><strong>AWS Service Roles</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Some AWS services need to interact with other AWS services <strong><em>for e.g. EC2 interacting with S3, SQS etc</em></strong></li>
<li>Best practice is to assign these services with IAM roles instead of embedding or passing IAM user credentials directly into an instance, because distributing and rotating long-term credentials to multiple instances is challenging to manage and a potential security risk.</li>
<li>AWS automatically provides temporary security credentials for these services <strong><em>e.g. Amazon EC2 instance to use on behalf of its applications</em></strong></li>
<li>Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with a running EC2 instance will break any applications running on the instance</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="complete-process-flow"><strong>Complete Process Flow</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a IAM role with services who would use it for e.g. <em>EC2 as trusted entity and define permission policies with the access the service needs</em></li>
<li><strong>Associated a Role (actually an Instance profile) with the EC2 service when the instance is launched</strong></li>
<li>Temporary security credentials are available on the instance and are automatically rotated before they expire so that a valid set is always available</li>
<li>Application can retrieve the temporary credentials either using the Instance metadata directly or through AWS SDK</li>
<li>Applications running on the EC2 instance can now use the permissions defined in the Role to access other AWS resources</li>
<li>Application, if caching the credentials, needs to make sure it uses the correct credentials before they expire</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="instance-profile"><strong>Instance Profile</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts.</li>
<li>If a Role is created for EC2 instance or any other service that uses EC2 through AWS Management Console, AWS creates a Instance profile automatically with the same name as the Role. However, if the Role is created through CLI the instance profile needs to created as well</li>
<li>An instance profile can contain only one IAM role. However, a role can be included in multiple instance profiles.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-4-cross-account-access-roles"><strong>7-4 Cross-Account access Roles</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>IAM users can be granted permission to switch roles within the same AWS account or to roles defined in other AWS accounts that you own.</li>
<li>Roles can also be used to delegate permissions to IAM users from AWS accounts owned by Third parties<ul>
<li>You must explicitly grant the users permission to assume the role.</li>
<li>Users must actively switch to the role using the AWS Management Console.</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) protection can be enabled for the role so that only users who sign in with an MFA device can assume the role</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, only One set of permissions are applicable at a time. User who assumes a role temporarily gives up his or her own permissions and instead takes on the permissions of the role. When the user exits, or stops using the role, the original user permissions are restored.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-5-complete-process-flow"><strong>7-5 Complete Process Flow</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/chap4_1_3.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Trusting account creates a IAM Role with a<ul>
<li>Trust policy which defines the account (trusted account) as a principal who can access the resources and a</li>
<li>Permissions policy to define what resources can the user in the trusted account access</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trusting account provides the Account ID and the Role name (or the ARN) to the trusted account</li>
<li>If the Trusting account is own by Third Party it can optionally provide an External ID (recommended for additional security), required to uniquely identify the trusted account, which can be added to the trust policy as a condition</li>
<li>Trusted account creates a IAM user who has permissions (Permission to call the <strong><em>AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) AssumeRole API for the role) to assume the role/switch to the role.</em></strong></li>
<li>IAM User in the Trusted account switches to the Role/assumes the role and passes the ARN of the role</li>
<li>Trusted account belonging to the Third party would also pass the External ID mapped to the Trusting account</li>
<li><strong><mark>AWS STS verifies the request for the role ARN, External ID if any and if it is from the trusted resource matching the roles’s trust policy and</mark></strong></li>
<li>AWS STS upon successful verification returns temporary credentials</li>
<li>Temporary credentials allow the user to access the resources of the Trusting account</li>
<li>When the user exits the role, the user’s permissions revert to the original permissions held before switching to the role</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-6-external-id-and-confused-deputy-problem"><strong>7-6 External ID and Confused Deputy Problem</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>External ID allows the user that is assuming the role to assert the circumstances in which they are operating.</li>
<li>External ID provides a way for the account owner to permit the role to be assumed only under specific circumstances and prevents an unauthorized customer from gaining access to your resources</li>
<li>Primary function of the external ID is to address and prevent the “confused deputy” problem.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="confused-deputy-problem"><strong>Confused Deputy Problem</strong></h4>
<p><img alt="Alt Image Text" src="../../images/chap4_1_4.png" title="Body image" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Example Corp’s AWS Account provides the services (access, analyze and process data and provide back reports) to multiple different AWS accounts</li>
<li>Preferred mechanism is to have each AWS account customer define a Role which Example Corp’s AWS Account users can assume and act upon</li>
<li>You provide Example Corp’s AWS Account access to your AWS account through Role and providing Role ARN</li>
<li>Example Corp when working on your account assumes the IAM role and provides the ARN with the request</li>
<li>As Example Corp is already trusted by your account it will received the temporary security credentials and gain access to your resources</li>
<li>If an other AWS account is able to know or guess your ARN (Role with Account ID), it can provide the same to Example Corp</li>
<li>Example Corp’s would use the ARN (belonging to your AWS account) to process the data but would provide the same data to the other AWS account</li>
<li>This form of privilege escalation is known as the confused deputy problem</li>
</ol>

<li>Using External ID, Example Corp’s generates a unique External ID for each of its Customer which is known only to them and is kept secret</li>
<li>Example Corp provides you an External ID which needs to added as a condition while defining the trust policy</li>
<li>You provide Example Corp’s AWS Account access to your AWS account through Role and providing Role ARN</li>
<li>Example Corp when working on your account uses the IAM role and provides the ARN along with the External ID and as it is already trusted would be able to gain access</li>
<li>Other AWS account registered with Example Corp would have a Unique External ID assigned to it</li>
<li>If the Other AWS account is able to know or guess your ARN (Role with Account ID), it can provide the same to Example Corp</li>
<li>Example Corp’s would request access to your Account using the ARN (belonging to your AWS account) but with the External ID belonging to Other AWS account as the request was made on its behalf</li>
<li>As the External ID provided by Example Corp does not match the condition defined in the Role trust policy, the authentication would fail and hence denied access</li>

<p>A customer is in the process of deploying multiple applications to AWS that are owned and operated by different development teams. Each development team maintains the authorization of its users independently from other teams. The customer’s information security team would like to be able to delegate user authorization to the individual development teams but independently apply restrictions to the users permissions based on factors such as the users device and location. For example, the information security team would like to grant read-only permissions to a user who is defined by the development team as read/write whenever the user is authenticating from outside the corporate network. What steps can the information security team take to implement this capability? [PROFESSIONAL]</p>
<ul>
<li>Operate an authentication service that generates AWS STS tokens with IAM policies from application-defined IAM roles. (no user separation, will just help generate temporary tokens)</li>
<li><strong>Add additional IAM policies to the application IAM roles that deny user privileges based on information security policy. (Different policy with deny rules based on location, device and more restrictive wins)</strong></li>
<li>Configure IAM policies that restrict modification of the application IAM roles only to the information security team. (Authorization should still be in developers control)</li>
<li>Enable federation with the internal LDAP directory and grant the application teams permissions to modify users.</li>

<li>IAM Policy Simulator can help test the following ways :-<ul>
<li>Test IAM based policies. If multiple policies attached, you can test all the policies, or select individual policies to test. You can test which actions are allowed or denied by the selected policies for specific resources.</li>
<li>Test Resource based policies. However, Resource based policies cannot be tested standalone and have to be attached with the Resource</li>
<li>Test new IAM policies that are not yet attached to a user, group, or role by typing or copying them into the simulator. These are used only in the simulation and are not saved.</li>
<li>Test the policies with selected services, actions, and resources</li>
<li>Simulate real-world scenarios by providing context keys, such as an IP address or date, that are included in Condition elements in the policies being tested.</li>
<li>Identify which specific statement in a policy results in allowing or denying access to a particular resource or action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IAM Policy Simulator does not make an actual AWS service request and hence does not make unwanted changes to the AWS live environment</li>
<li><strong>IAM Policy Simulator just reports the result Allowed or Denied</strong></li>
<li>IAM Policy Simulator allows to you modify the policy and test. These changes are not propogated to the actual policies attached to the entities</li>
